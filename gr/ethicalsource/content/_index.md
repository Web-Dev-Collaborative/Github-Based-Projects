## The Ethical Evolution of Open Source

The Open Source Definition (OSD) was written in 1998 by the Open Source Initiative to promote the adoption of software with source licensed for free use by anyone. But the emphasis of the OSD is on technical licensing requirements, which, while important, do not really define the practice of open source as experienced by millions of developers around the world over the past two decades. The true definition of open source is broader than simply licensing concerns.

In the twenty years since Christine Peterson first coined the term, our community has developed its own working definition of open source: code that is written collaboratively, in the open, and is distributed for use, combination, or remixing. For a long time, the distinction between the "official" definition and our more practical one was not a source of significant conflict.

But today is different. There is an increasing demand from open source developers to take control of how our software is being used. We donâ€™t want our code used to aid those who commit human rights violations or other unethical behavior. We believe that the organizations that benefit from our labor have a moral obligation to give back to our community, whether through contributions to the software or material support for the people who create and maintain the code they build their businesses on.

Historically, we in the open source community have not had the tools to enforce fair, ethical, and community-minded terms for those who benefit from our labor. And the Open Source Initiative continually undermines our efforts to develop these tools, prioritizing software freedom over individual freedom.

The organizations that claim ownership of the definition of free and open source software have ignored their obligations to the community and failed to address our growing concerns. The time has come to reclaim authority over what it means to develop software in the open while not compromising our needs and ideals as creators.

We are at the beginning of the era of [Ethical Source Software]({{< ref "definition.md" >}}).
