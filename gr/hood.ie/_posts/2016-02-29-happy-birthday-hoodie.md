We’re going to have a lot more to celebrate this year, and coming very soon is the Camp Release on our roadmap to Hoodie 1.0!

Up until eight months ago, we’ve had Hoodie built up to be a nice, standalone house that a large family could comfortably live in. It showed Hoodie’s potential and got a lot of people interested and now we’ve got a good number of apps built with it and it’s even being used commercially. A full success. 

But who wants to live in a house alone? Most of the fun of what we’ve been able to create has been working together with the folks in our amazing community — you! So we changed our roadmap to look something more like roughing it in “Camp” with folks and working together to create our own Hoodie “Village” in preparation of growing the community one day into a “City” of Open Source champions valuing inclusivity, diversity of contributors, and creative collaboration.

So with that in mind, we’ve been calling our next development milestone the “Hoodie Camp Release” informally.

The idea is Hoodie, as a product, is not ready. It’s like a tent, while providing shelter, it’s a tarp some sticks and lines, not too comfortable, but it gets the job done for a couple of nights. But the Hoodie Camp is less about the product (the tent), and more about the experience. 

If you don’t expect a shiny hotel room with everything included, but love a unique adventure with great people, and would love to help move Hoodie forward together with us, then now is the right time for you to get involved — and we would love to have you camping with us.

The goal of this Camp milestone is to attract contributors, people who care about Hoodie and help move it forward, be it with code, documentation, design, or editorial work.

One of the main ways you can help us get more contributors is to help write, curate, and promote [high quality starter issues](http://hood.ie/blog/starter-issues.html). We have put a lot of effort into creating [great sample Starter Issues](http://go.hood.ie/hoodie-starter-issues). 

If you’re ready to give the new Hoodie a spin, try out our [new Hoodie Tracker App right here](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker). 

Combined, we’ll all move Hoodie towards the second milestone the “Village Release”, recruiting developers, re-adding plugins and growing the product ecosystem and later, the third milestone, the “City Release” focused on finding users.

[Won’t you please join us?](http://hood.ie/contribute/) After all, it is our birthday. *wink wink*
