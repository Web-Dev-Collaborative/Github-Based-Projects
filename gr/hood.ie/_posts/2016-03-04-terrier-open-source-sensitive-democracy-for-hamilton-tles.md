## Design

> I’ve been paying close attention to these small breaks in UX that some people seem so happy to write off — the misplaced humor, the snotty error messages, the binary gender selection boxes, the assumptions about sexuality, the inability to select more than one race. What I’ve realized is that the best way to look at them is as a series of microaggressions.

>Lots of people think caring about these microaggressions is a waste of time, too: Stop being so sensitive! There are more important issues in the world! Everyone’s a victim these days!

> Mostly the people who don’t experience them.

> For those who do, they’re exhausting. They stack up over the course of a day, a week at work, a lifetime of being fed the same BS. A million tiny moments where you were reminded that you don’t fit in, or that you’re not “normal,” or that others view your body as fair game.

## The Business

> Most of these people don’t believe in anything except their balance sheet, and they know how to add two and two. On political interests: they are a parallelogram of different and typically conflicting goals, never defined by one goal only: industrial capital, financial capital, governing parties, states, sometimes the labor aristocracy, all interacting under the pressure of — changing — power relations.

> There was nothing phoenix-like in my sister’s immolation. Just the scent of charred skin, unbearable heat, the inharmonious sound of her last, grief-raw scream as she evaporated, leaving glass footprints seared into the desert sand.
