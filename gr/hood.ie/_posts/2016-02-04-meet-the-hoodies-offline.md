Maybe you’ve heard about Hoodie at a conference, or read about on Twitter, or through our initiatives like Offline First and noBackend and want to learn more, or you just want to get started with contributing to a meaningful Open Source project. Either way: **Meet the Hoodies is for you**!

## Let’s meet the Hoodies!

We would love to come visit your city and organise a fun workshop for new and experienced open source contributors, to give an introduction to Hoodie and above all: to meet you in person.

While we love to see the Hoodie community grow, meeting you in person is what makes all the difference. These Github avatars are never going to be the same once you meet the friendly humans behind it – That goes both ways :)

The setup is simple: we maintain a [list of great starter issues](http://go.hood.ie/hoodie-starter-issues) to make it as simple and fun as possible to start contributing to Hoodie. Attendees can choose any issue to work on and and get all support you need from Hoodie hosts.

## New York City!

[The first “Meet the Hoodies”](https://ti.to/hoodie/hello-nyc/) event happened in New York City on November 12th, hosted by [Gregor](http://twitter.com/gr2m) and [Nick](http://twitter.com/hipsterbrown).

And because it was so nice, [we came right back](https://ti.to/hoodie/hello-nyc-part-2/) on December 13, this time co-hosted by [Patricia](http://twitter.com/patggs).

Special thanks to [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/) and especially Brian for being such great hosts for our events.

## Berlin!

We kicked off the year with [another “Meet the Hoodies”](https://ti.to/hoodie/berlin-meet-the-hoodies/) event, this time in Europe. A lot of Hoodies live or moved here, so it couldn’t take too long to organise another event here.

It was a lot of fun, and we hope to make it more regularly in future. Thanks to [co.up Coworking](http://co-up.de) for providing their wonderful space!

## Frankfurt/Main!

[Tobias](http://twitter.com/tbaldauf) heard about the Hoodie event in Berlin and was ready to come all the way from Frankfurt, but as Gregor would spend time in Frankfurt anyway, why not meet the Hoodies again! And so [it happened](https://ti.to/hoodie/frankfurt-meet-the-hoodies).

Thanks to [Die Zentrale Coworking](https://www.die-zentrale-ffm.de/) for hosting us <3

## Where to meet the Hoodies?

We would love to come to your city and meet you! Give us a shout [@hoodiehq](http://twitter.com/hoodiehq) if you would like us to host an event. All it takes is a location and a sponsor for the travel expenses of one of our Hoodie humans. And if we can combine it with a Hoodie talk at one of your local meet ups – even better :)
