        <h1 class="h2">What we believe in and how we act</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoodie's main goal is to empower people and enable them to realize their ideas. Thus, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, culture, ethnicity, gender expression, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal ability or disability, physical appearance, physical or mental difference, race, religion, set of skills, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people regardless of these or other attributes.</li>
            <li>Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement.</li>
            <li>We believe that a diverse community where people treat each other with respect is stronger, more vibrant and has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas. We aim for more diversity.</li>
            <li>We are kind, welcoming and courteous to everyone.</li>
            <li>We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments and their efforts.</li>
            <li>We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.</li>
            <li>We are aware that language shapes reality. Thus, we use inclusive, gender-neutral language in the documents we provide and when we talk to people. When referring to a group of people, we aim to use gender-neutral terms like “team”, “folks”, “everyone”. (For details, we recommend <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/gendered-language-feature-or-bug-in-software-documentation" target="_blank">this post</a>).</li>
            <li>We respect that people have differences of opinion and criticize constructively.</li>

        <h1 class="h2">Don’ts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t be mean or rude.</li>
            <li>Don’t discriminate against anyone.</li>
            <li>Sexism and racism of any kind (including sexist and racist “jokes”), demeaning or insulting behaviour and harassment are seen as direct violations to this Code of Conduct. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to age, body size, culture, ethnicity, gender expression, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal ability or disability, physical appearance, physical or mental difference, race, religion, set of skills, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
            <li>On IRC, Slack and other online or offline communications channels, don't use overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.</li>
            <li>Respect that some individuals and cultures consider the casual use of profanity offensive and off-putting.</li>
            <li>Unwelcome / non-consensual sexual advances over IRC or any other channels related with this community are not okay.</li>
            <li>Derailing, tone arguments and otherwise playing on people’s desires to be nice are not welcome, especially in discussions about violations to this Code of Conduct.</li>
            <li>Please avoid unstructured critique.</li>
            <li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.</li>
            <li>Sponsors of Hoodie are also subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, sponsors are required to not use sexualized images, activities, or other material which is not according to this Code of Conduct.</li>
