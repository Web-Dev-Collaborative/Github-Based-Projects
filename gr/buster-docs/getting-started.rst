Getting started
===============

This guide walks you through installation and very basic setup of tests in a
project. If you're only interested in simple browser tests embedded in a web
page, see :doc:`the browser testing <browser-testing>` page.


Installing
==========

Buster.JS on the command-line requires Node.js 0.6.3 or newer and npm. Node.js
0.6.3 and newer comes with npm bundled on most platforms.


OS X
----

1. Get the latest Node installer from `nodejs.org <http://nodejs.org/>`_. You
   need Node 0.6.3 or newer.
2. ``npm install -g buster``

.. note::

    Installing npm packages with ``sudo`` causes multiple problems, and is
    not recommended.  If you cannot use npm without sudo after using the
    installer, try changing ownership of the node installation to your user.


Linux
-----
1. Install Node 0.6.3 or later with your favorite package manager. If you
   don't have one, follow these simple `build instructions
   <https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation>`_.
2. ``npm install -g buster``


Windows
-------

Windows support is right around the corner. Hang in there.


Create config file
==================

Add a config file to your project. Call it ``test/buster.js``
or ``spec/buster.js``. This way you don't have to tell Buster.JS about it
with ``--config`` every time you run tests. ``./buster.js`` will
also be recognized.

::

    var config = module.exports;

    config["My tests"] = {
        rootPath: "../",
        environment: "browser", // or "node"
        sources: [
            "lib/mylib.js",
            "lib/**/*.js"
        ],
        tests: [
            "test/*-test.js"
        ]
    }

    // Add more configuration groups as needed


For browser tests, list all your source files in ``sources`` and test files in
``tests``. For Node.js tests, you don't need to specify ``sources`` as you
typically ``require`` your source files directly in the test files.

Read the full :ref:`configuration <buster-configuration>` documentation for
details.

Note that you may not "dot out" in ``sources``, ``tests``, etc. Paths are
resolved relative to the directory where the configuration file lives. If your
sources live outside this directory, adjust the root directory using the
``rootPath`` property (which is also resolved against the config file location,
unless absolute).


Write tests
===========

Given the config file above, all files named ``<something>-test.js`` in the
same folder as the config file itself will be loaded. You can of course change
the glob pattern to better suit your needs. ``**/*-test.js`` would for
example recursively load all ``<something>-test.js`` in the same folder the
config file is in, and all its sub folders.

A test case looks like this::

    // Browser tests

    buster.testCase("A module", {
        "states the obvious": function () {
            assert(true);
        }
    });


The BDD inclined might prefer this alternate syntax::

    buster.spec.expose(); // Make some functions global

    describe("A module", function () {
        it("states the obvious", function () {
            expect(true).toEqual(true);
        });
    });

If your test is a Node.js test, you also need to require Buster.JS::

    // Node.js tests
    var buster = require("buster");
    var myLib = require("../lib/my-lib");

    buster.testCase("A module", {
        "states the obvious": function () {
            assert(true);
        }
    });

See the full :ref:`buster-test-case` docs and :ref:`buster-assertions` docs
for details. There are also mocks and stubs and more, via the
:ref:`buster-sinon` module.


Run tests
=========

Node.js tests
-------------

Node.js tests can be run by simply typing ``node test/some-test.js``.  Doing
this requires nothing more than a file with tests (i.e. you don't need the
above configuration).

While ``node test/my-test.js`` is nice and convenient, you want to use the
``buster-test`` binary to get at the full power of Buster.JS. Open a terminal,
``cd`` to your project, and type in ``buster test``.  Here's the output from
the test run of :ref:`posix-argv-parser`:

See the :doc:`Node.js testing <node-testing>` documentation for more.


Browser tests
-------------

First, start a server. Open a terminal and type in ``buster server``.

Capture some browsers to run the tests in by visiting the URL. Click the grey
capture button to actually perform the capture.

Then you're ready to run the tests with ``buster test``.

See the :doc:`browser testing <browser-testing>` documentation for more.


Hybrid tests
------------

If your project has both Node.js and browser tests, and your config file specifies
multiple groups for the different environments, running ``buster test`` will
automatically run all the groups, both Node.js and browser. This requires that you
already have a ``buster server`` up and running.

If you only want to run tests for one environment, use
``buster test --environment browser`` or ``buster test -e node``.

You have to manually make sure your test cases and source files are able to run
in both browsers and Node.js. Here's an example::

    if (typeof require != "undefined") {
        var buster = require("buster");
        var myLib = require("../lib/my-lib");
    }

    buster.testCase("A test case", {
        "test it": function () {
            assert(true);
        }
    });

See the :doc:`hybrid testing <hybrid-testing>` documentation for more.
