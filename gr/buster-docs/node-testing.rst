Node.js testing

Getting started
===============

To set up Node.JS testing, specify ``"node"`` as the environment in your config
file::

    var config = module.exports;

    config["My tests"] = {
        environment: "node",
        tests: [
            "**/*-test.js"
        ]
    };

This config file will load all ``<something>-test.js`` in the same folder as
the config file and all sub folders. Unlike browser tests, you don't need to
specify your source files with ``"sources"``. In fact, doing so will only make
the tests slower, as the config file takes longer time to load. Instead, you do
what you always do in Node.JS: ``require()`` the modules you use in the files
where you need to use them::

    var buster = require("buster");
    var myLib = require("../lib/my-lib");

    buster.testCase("A test case", {
        "test it": function () {
            assert(true);
        }
    });

As we can see, we also need to require Buster.JS itself. The ``buster`` module
provides all the core functionality such as test cases, assertions, and more.


Running tests
=============

To run the tests, simply type::

    buster test

Here's the test output for the :ref:`posix-argv-parser` module:

See :ref:`buster test --help <buster-test-options>` for more information about
the options you can pass to ``buster test``.
