# Good First Issue: Examples

Good First Issue can be consumed as a Node.js module. This directory includes examples of how you can use it to programatically surface Good First Issues.

## Examples

- [node.js](./node.js): An example of how you can consume the module using async/await and stitch together data from Good First Issue to create useful output without other external dependencies.
- [github.js](./github.js): An example that's almost identical to the `node.js` example, except it utilizes the org/repo search functionality rather than using a project identifier.

If you'd like to see another example, please feel free to sumbit a PR â€“ we'd love to have your contribution! ðŸ¤—
